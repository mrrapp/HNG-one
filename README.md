#  a Mobile Application with Personal Details

HNG 2023 internship, task one.

## Getting Started

Objective: Create a mobile application that prominently features your Slack identity, incorporates your Slack profile picture, and includes an “Open GitHub” button. When pressed, this button should utilize a WebView component to redirect users to your GitHub profile within the application itself.
Requirements:
1. Slack Name: The application’s main screen should prominently display your Slack name.
2. Display Picture: Integrate your Slack display picture onto the main screen, ensuring it’s clear and of high quality.
3. Open GitHub Button: Add a button labeled “Open GitHub” to the main screen. When pressed, it should correctly redirect users to your GitHub profile using a WebView component within the application.
